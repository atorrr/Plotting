# PlottingThCalcExpAgree :snowflake:

I am plotting a Theoretical Study and Experimental Agreement of the rotational constants from electronic excited states of organic molecules.

:love_letter: The idea is to have to codes that plot the results of my Theoretical Study.

The Theoretical Study consist of TD-DFT calculations using different combinations of (15) exchange-correlation functionals and (7) basis sets.
We are testing 10 molecular systems, all of them aromatic organic molecules.
We are comparing the agreement :couple: of theoretical rotational constants (A', B', C') obtained by TD-DFT calculations with the experimental ones.


:paperclip: File plot_rmsd makes a comparison of the weighted RMSD computed from each set of rotational constants (A', B', C') with the experimental values.
The lowest RMSD value ist better. 

:paperclip: plot_ABC file plot the difference in MHz of the theoretical rotational constants (A', B', C') ontained and the experimental value.
